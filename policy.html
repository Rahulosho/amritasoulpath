                            I understand that life can be unpredictable, and sometimes plans change. To keep things clear and fair for everyone:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you need to cancel, refunds are available for cancellations made on or before <strong>September 8, 2025</strong> (minus any processing fees).</li>
                            <li>Beginning <strong>September 9, 2025</strong>, I won’t be able to offer refunds, as all retreat logistics and bookings will already be finalized.</li>
                            <li>If something comes up and you can’t join us, you’re more than welcome to transfer your spot to a friend or loved one at any time.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            I truly want this retreat to be a beautiful and stress-free experience for you, from the moment you say “yes” until the day we gather together.
                        </p>
